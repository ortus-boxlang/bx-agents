# gateways/

`gateways/*.bx`/`.json` files under this one folder cover **two distinct, unrelated things** - which kind an entry is depends entirely on whether its `configure()` struct has an `exposes` key.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't confuse these with each other - an HTTP-exposed agent (`exposes: "agent"`) is a REST API for your agent; a channel-adapter gateway (`type: "http"`) is a webhook endpoint for a chat platform or human-in-the-loop approval flow. They generate completely different routes.
{% endhint %}

## 1. HTTP/MCP exposure (`exposes: "agent" | "mcp"`)

Exposes the agent, or a local MCP server, over HTTP using ColdBox 8.1's native AI Routing DSL.

**Expose the agent:**

```javascript
// gateways/expose.bx
class {

	function configure() {
		return {
			exposes : "agent",
			path    : "/api/chat"
		};
	}

}
```

Generates, in `config/Router.bx`:

```javascript
route( "/api/chat" ).toAi( "GeneratedAgent" )
```

which auto-registers **four** sub-routes: `POST /api/chat/invoke`, `POST /api/chat/stream` (SSE), `POST /api/chat/batch`, `GET /api/chat/info`. The bare `/api/chat` path itself is not routable.

**Expose a local MCP server** (see [mcp/](mcp.md)):

```javascript
class {
	function configure() {
		return {
			exposes : "mcp",
			path    : "/mcp/tools",
			target  : "local-server"   // must match an mcp/*.bx entry's declared name
		};
	}
}
```

Generates `route( "/mcp/tools" ).toMCP( "local-server" )`.

**Validation:** `exposes` must be `agent` or `mcp`; `path` is required and must be unique across every exposure entry; an `mcp` exposure's `target` is required and must match a real `mcp/*` entry's declared name.

## 2. Channel-adapter gateways (`type: "mock" | "cli" | "http"`)

Registers a bx-ai `IGateway` (a channel adapter for external delivery / human-in-the-loop approval) by name - distinct from exposing the agent's own REST API.

```javascript
// gateways/slack.bx
class {
	function configure() {
		return {
			type         : "http",
			secretEnvVar : "SLACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
		};
	}
}
```

`secretEnvVar` names an environment variable holding the signing secret - **never the secret value itself**. Generates, in `Application.bx`'s `onApplicationStart()`:

```javascript
aiGatewayRegistry().register( aiGateway( "http", { secret : getSystemSetting( "SLACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET", "" ) } ) )
```

The secret is resolved live at server startup, matching this project's "secrets stay external" rule everywhere else (see [Deployment & Secrets](../deployment-and-secrets.md)) - it's never embedded as a literal in generated source, so it's never present in a packaged `.bxa` either. If the env var is unset, bx-ai's own `HttpGateway` treats an empty secret as "no signing configured" and rejects requests accordingly, rather than crashing at startup.

**Validation:** `type` must be `mock`, `cli`, or `http`; a `type: "http"` entry requires a `secretEnvVar`; the entry's own file/base name must be unique across every channel-adapter entry. `mock` is test-only; `cli` is bx-ai's own built-in human-in-the-loop **approval** channel (a blocking stdin/stdout A/R/Q prompt) - it's what `HumanInTheLoopMiddleware` attaches by default when no gateway is specified, and is unrelated to BX Agents' own `chat` verb (which never touches the gateway registry at all).

**`http`-type entries additionally get real HTTP wiring**: a generated `handlers/Gateway.bx` action that proxies straight into bx-ai's own `GatewayRequestProcessor::processHttp()`, and three routes in `config/Router.bx`:

```javascript
post( "/gateways/:gatewayName/events" ).toHandler( "Gateway.process" )
get( "/interactions/:requestID" ).toHandler( "Gateway.process" )
post( "/interactions/:requestID/decisions" ).toHandler( "Gateway.process" )
```

{% hint style="info" %}
ColdBox has no built-in `toAiGateway()` DSL terminator for this surface (only `toAi()` and `toMCP()` exist natively) - this wiring is BX Agents' own generated code, following the same shape a future core terminator would produce. See the [`toAiGateway()` for ColdBox Core](../proposals/toAiGateway-coldbox-core.md) proposal.
{% endhint %}

## 3. Push-style gateways (`type: "telegram"` / `"slack"`, and friends)

A different kind of channel adapter from `mock`/`cli`/`http` above: instead of being driven by an inbound HTTP request, a push-style gateway holds its own connection to the platform and pushes inbound messages to your agent as they arrive - the closer-to-"real chat bot" experience. Two transport shapes exist today:

- **Long-poll** (Telegram): a scheduled task periodically asks the platform "anything new?".
- **Persistent websocket** (Slack, via Socket Mode): the gateway holds a live, long-running connection the platform pushes events down in real time.

```javascript
// gateways/telegramChannel.bx
class {
	function configure() {
		return {
			type          : "telegram",
			botTokenEnvVar: "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
		};
	}
}
```

```javascript
// gateways/slackChannel.bx
class {
	function configure() {
		return {
			type          : "slack",
			botTokenEnvVar: "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN",   // xoxb-... - chat.postMessage/chat.update
			appTokenEnvVar: "SLACK_APP_TOKEN"    // xapp-... - apps.connections.open (Socket Mode)
		};
	}
}
```

Same "secrets stay external" rule as `http`'s `secretEnvVar`: every `*EnvVar` key names an environment variable, resolved live via `getSystemSetting()` at startup, never embedded as a literal. Unlike the core types, a push-style gateway's class lives inside BX Agents itself (`models/gateways/*.bx`, not bx-ai), so its registration renders as a bare class path rather than a short name:

```javascript
aiGatewayRegistry().register( aiGateway( "bxModules.bxagents.models.gateways.TelegramGateway", { "botToken" : getSystemSetting( "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN", "" ) } ) )
aiGatewayRegistry().register( aiGateway( "bxModules.bxagents.models.gateways.SlackGateway", { "appToken" : getSystemSetting( "SLACK_APP_TOKEN", "" ), "botToken" : getSystemSetting( "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN", "" ) } ) )
```

**Validation:** `type: "telegram"` requires `botTokenEnvVar`; `type: "slack"` requires both `botTokenEnvVar` and `appTokenEnvVar` - checked the same way `http`'s `secretEnvVar` is.

{% hint style="info" %}
Slack v1 is **Socket Mode only** - no public webhook endpoint is needed or generated for it (unlike `http`, which gets real routes - see §2 above). The Events-API/HTTP-webhook alternative Slack also supports isn't built here.
{% endhint %}

### Slack's persistent connection

`SlackGateway` holds its websocket via `java.net.http.HttpClient`'s async WebSocket client, bridged from a BoxLang listener class that `implements="java:java.net.http.WebSocket$Listener"` directly (`models/gateways/support/SlackSocketListener.bx`) - BoxLang compiles this as a real JVM implementer of the interface, confirmed empirically by handing an instance straight to `HttpClient.newWebSocketBuilder().buildAsync( uri, listener )` with no casting error (only the expected `java.net.ConnectException` once the real network boundary was reached). Only the methods the class actually declares override the JDK interface's `default` methods; anything left unimplemented falls through to the JDK's own default behavior automatically. This is the reference pattern any future persistent-connection gateway (Discord) follows too.

Reconnects are driven reactively by Slack's own protocol signals - a `disconnect` frame (`warning`/`refresh_requested`) or an unexpected socket close - opening a **new** connection before closing the old one, per Slack's documented recommendation. A lightweight scheduler watchdog (`slack-watchdog-<name>`, every 30s) is only a safety net for the case neither of those signals fires.

### GatewaySession - wiring the agent to every push-style gateway

Any project with at least one push-style gateway entry also gets a generated `interceptors/GatewaySessionBootstrap.bx`, which builds a single bx-ai `GatewaySession` bundling every push-style gateway in the project, bound to the project's root agent, and starts it once ColdBox itself has finished loading:

```javascript
// interceptors/GatewaySessionBootstrap.bx (GENERATED)
class {
	function afterConfigurationLoad( event, interceptData ) {
		var wirebox        = getController().getWireBox()
		var agent          = wirebox.getInstance( "GeneratedAgent" )
		var gatewaySession = aiGatewaySession(
			agent        : agent,
			gateways     : [ aiGatewayRegistry().get( "telegramChannel" ) ],
			policy       : "queue",
			maxQueueDepth: 50
		)
		gatewaySession.start()
		application.bxaiGatewaySession = gatewaySession
	}
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The generated variable is deliberately named `gatewaySession`, not `session` - `session` is a reserved BoxLang/ColdBox scope name (like `request`/`server`/`url`/`form`/`cgi`/`thread`), and a local variable reusing one of those names can collide with the live scope instead of behaving as an ordinary local.
{% endhint %}

An interceptor (not a raw `Application.bx`/`onApplicationStart()` statement, unlike the plain registration calls above) is used specifically because its `afterConfigurationLoad` point is guaranteed by ColdBox's own lifecycle to fire strictly after the framework - including the scheduler these gateways depend on (see below) - has finished loading.

Control `GatewaySession`'s policy via an optional `gatewaySession` block on the root project's `Agent.bx`:

```javascript
// Agent.bx
function configure() {
	return {
		name  : "...",
		model : "...",
		gatewaySession: { policy: "queue", maxQueueDepth: 50 }   // both optional - these are the defaults
	};
}
```

`policy` must be one of `reject`/`queue`/`steer`/`interrupt` (bx-ai's own `GatewaySession` policy vocabulary - see the [Gateway Sessions](../gateways.md) overview) - checked at `build` time so a typo fails loudly instead of surfacing as a runtime error the first time the app boots.

{% hint style="warning" %}
v1 limitation: exactly one `GatewaySession`, always bound to the project's root agent - matches the existing precedent that `exposes: "agent"` HTTP exposure is also always root-agent-only. A project with subagents cannot yet route different gateways to different subagents.
{% endhint %}

### How a push-style gateway stays connected: the shared ColdBox Scheduler

Rather than a new background-loop primitive, push-style gateways reach the app's own live ColdBox scheduler singleton (`appScheduler@coldbox` - the same one a hand-written `schedules/Scheduler.bx`, if the project has one, runs under) and register their own named task(s) into it dynamically - a recurring long-poll task for Telegram, for example. **One shared scheduler, every push-style gateway registering its own tasks into it** - never one scheduler per gateway, and never in conflict with a project's own cron jobs.

### Logging

Every push-style gateway writes to its own `gateway-<type>` log file (e.g. `gateway-telegram`) via BoxLang's `writeLog()`, rather than one shared/default app log - so an operator can tail exactly the platform they care about without noise from everything else the app logs.
